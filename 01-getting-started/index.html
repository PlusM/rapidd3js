        content = d3.selectAll("#content"); # select the div from the HTML DOM into a variable called content
        ul = content.append("ul"); #append a un-numbered list to the div
        data = ["Item 1","Item 2","Item 3"]; #create an array of 3 data text list entries
        ul.selectAll('li').data(data).enter().append('li').text(function(d) { return d; });
        
        #Five key things happen above (number for the command split by .) :-
        #1. create virtual/placeholder line tags (b/c there is nothing to put in them right now)
        #2. the placeholder has its data set to the array of 3 items
        #3. enter() iterates through the data that **does not exist yet** in the list
        #This is important to note: we have three items in the data, but no li elements created
        #therefore we have three new items for the enter() to create in the DOM
        #4. Each time enter() processes, it appends a new li element to the DOM
        #5. Finally we set the text, the function is called with the current data item in the iterator,
        #and return the data value passed and the list item text is set to the value of that iteration

        data = ["Item A","Item B","Item C","Item D"]; #refresh the data variable with changed values and one extra
        ul.selectAll('li').data(data).enter().append('li').text(function(d) { return d; });
        
        #running the same command again will leave the first three items unchanged and add the fourth
        #this is because enter() will only enter in new items - it already has three line items and doesn't overwrite
        #if you go and look at the data property of the element (using element inspector), you should see that the data
        #has been updated, it just hasn't been put into the DOM

        ul.selectAll('li').text(function(d) {return d;});
        #this should refresh all items with the text now in d

        data = ["Item 1","Item 2","Item 3"]; #change the list back to its original state
        items = ul.selectAll('li').data(data); #select all the li elements from the ul variable and insert data
        #this creates a variable that looks like your list should do in HTML, tags+data

        items.exit().remove();
        #this will remove any elements where there is no corresponding data for it
        #in other words, we've just recreated a list of three items, which is one less than currently in the DOM
        #So we've then used the exit() command to do the opposite of the enter() command
        #i.e. instead of only entering in data where it doesn't already exist, this removes data where it doesn't exist
        #so it will remove the last one only, as it has 4 li elements and only three items
        #note that, also like enter(), it will not update the elements already there with coresponding data
        #even if that data is not what you want

        items.text(function(d) {return d;});
        #now you can update the text content (note you're not using enter here as it wouldn't do any good)

        #that's everything you need to know about the essence of how D3 works
        #adding and removing elements in the DOM is what it's all about
        #anything on top of that is gravy
        #all the drawings, tables, manipulations are nothing without inserting and removing from the DOM
